## Slack

[Download](https://slack.com/downloads) the Slack native app from the Slack page. In **Linux (Beta)** section, choose **Ubuntu 64-bit** and download it.

Then install it:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo dpkg -i slack-desktop-*.deb
```

Launch the app and sign in to `pisano-summercamp` organization.

Make sure you upload a picture there.

You can also sign in to Slack on your iPhone or Android device!

The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

Enjoy your Summer Camp at Pisano :)
